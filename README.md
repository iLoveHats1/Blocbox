This is my first design project ever! For this assignment I am creating an app where you can save content like images, links, and notes.
The process has been to learn design basics like wireframing, logo creation, hi-fidelity wireframing, prototyping, and User testing.
I am now at the step of taking my visual designs and adding them to Github.
